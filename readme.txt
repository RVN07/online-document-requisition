NOTE: 

This "Online Document Requisition" system was made as a Thesis project for my 1st semester of my 4th year in college.

IF you're downloading it as reference or baseline, please check the declared identifiers in the code (especially in the front end side )
if they're matching.

Quick Overview:

A certain web application created using Flutter SDK (Dart programming language) as the front end and Laravel (a PHP-based web framework) as its backend.

where residents of a certain barangay can efficiently request documents online, 
where their details can be edited in a Profile section, and for requesting documents, they'll pick a certain document and, 
it will automatically generate a QR code, containing information and the document they've requested, and
Barangay staff has a dedicated QR code scanner as a mobile app for said QR Code for claiming said documents.
And also it also has a chatbot that acts as a help desk through buttons that contains general questions about the said system,
